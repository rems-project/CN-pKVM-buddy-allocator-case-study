# pKVM buddy allocator case study

This repository contains a case study in C code verification using the
CN type system: the buddy allocator of the pKVM hypervisor for
Android.

The original files in the version we verified can be found in the [android-kvm repositories](https://android-kvm.googlesource.com/linux/+/39111fc40453747f8213cf9ef4337448d3c6197d/arch/arm64/kvm/hyp/nvhe/page_alloc.c).

Each file has a comment recording the original source code location in
the Linux source tree, retaining the original license/copyright
headers. Comments in the files point out where the code has been
modified (minor edits and additions).




The directory structure is as follows:

- `page_alloc.c` contains the main body of the buddy allocator logic.

- `gfp.h` defines the buddy allocator API described in the paper.

- `memory.h` contains a number of auxiliary definitions of functions
  and types. 
  
- `lemmas.h`

  - declares uninterpreted functions used in the proof,

  - states lemmas, and

  - defines resource predicates and logical functions, including the
    main invariant, Hyp_pool.

- `coq_lemmas` is the directory for the Coq part of the verification:

  - `theories/Gen_Spec.v` contains the lemma statements generated by
    CN,
  
  - `theories/Buddy_Aligned.v` proofs about alignment and 'buddy' as
    specification concepts,

  - `theories/Pages_Aligned.v` proofs about invariants of this buddy
    allocator formalisation,

  - `theories/Inst_Spec.v` the instantiation of the Coq module
    specifications in `Gen_Spec.v`.


- other `*.h`: these are various dependencies of the buddy allocator
  from the linux source tree.
